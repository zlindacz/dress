I will be using WebGL and HTML5 Canvas to create a 3D model of a dress, similar to this 3D cloud model: https://www.clicktorelease.com/code/css3dclouds/#. There will be a sidebar where the user can toggle certain features of the dress, such as hem length, sleeve length, color, and body measurements (bonus).

MVP:
1. sidebar with options for hem and sleeve lengths and color
2. 3d rendering of dress on the right
3. dress can rotate with mouse movements
4. toggle fullscreen

Bonus:
1. dress is proportional to user input of body measurements
2. incorporate lighting
3. user can upload a pattern (cloudinary)
4. user can save image
